# Fake-News-Detection-Project
In this project, I trained various machine learning models to predict fake news from Twitter data. The project itself is not new, as there have been numerous machine learning analyses performed on the same data also relaying the same conclusion. I, however, take the analysis a step further by looking at model interpretability, that is, looking at why the model is predicting the way it does. I do this by using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations or LIME which analyzes the keywords the model uses to make a prediction in favor of a class label.
