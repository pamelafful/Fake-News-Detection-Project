# Fake-News-Detection-Project
Fake News Classification Project from Tweet Data. I firstly conduct exploratory dta analysis on the data, looking at text Polarity and Subjectivity as well as looking at the most frequently used words within the tweet data.
I initially use multiple models to train and test the model. I then also take the analysis a step further interpreting the model results using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME).
